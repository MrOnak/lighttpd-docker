# lighttpd Docker image

Lighttpd on Alpine Linux, ready for SSL and virtual hosts.

## Build

To build this yourself:

* fork my repo https://github.com/MrOnak/lighttpd-docker.git
* create a local clone of your repository
* within your local clone, build your docker image:
  * with docker: `docker build .`
  * OR with docker compose: `docker compose build`

## Usage

Before starting anything do have a look at `data/config/lighttpd.conf` and adapt the configuration to your needs. The `lighttpd.conf` file itself only contains the fundamentals. 

Any configuration of a lighttpd module or virtualhost config is assumed to be in individual files within `data/config/`: 

* add module configs as `data/config/mod_*.conf`
* add virtual host configs as `data/config/vhost_*.conf`

In a module config you will need to register the module itself before writing the actual configuration:

```
server.modules += (
  "mod_access",
)
```

### a word about HTTP and HTTPS

The image comes with mod_openssl and mod_rewrite enabled. Place certificates for the main host and all virtual hosts in `data/certs/`.

By default lighttpd will serve HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443.

If you want to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, have a look at `data/config/mod_rewrite.conf`.

### docker compose

A working docker-compose.yml file is provided as inpiration. Tweak to your needs.

### serving a single site

```
version: "3.0"
services:
  lighttpd:
    build: .
    image: docker-lighttpd:latest
    container_name: lighttpd
    hostname: lighttpd
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - ./data/config:/etc/lighttpd # lighttpd configs, including vhosts and mods
      - ./data/certs:/var/www/certs # place SSL certificates here
      - ./data/htdocs:/var/www/htdocs # htdocs for the default host
    restart: unless-stopped
    tty: true
```

### serving multiple sites through virtual hosts

```
version: "3.0"
services:
  lighttpd:
    build: .
    image: docker-lighttpd:latest
    container_name: lighttpd
    hostname: lighttpd
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - ./data/config:/etc/lighttpd # lighttpd configs, including vhosts and mods
      - ./data/certs:/var/www/certs # place SSL certificates here
      - ./data/htdocs:/var/www/htdocs # htdocs for the default host
      - ./data/vhosts/vhost1:/var/www/vhost1 # example folder for virtual host
      - ./data/vhosts/vhost2:/var/www/vhost2 # example folder for virtual host
    restart: unless-stopped
    tty: true
```
